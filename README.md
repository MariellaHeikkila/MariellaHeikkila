<h1 style="font-size: 24px;">Hello there! 👋</h1>



Welcome to check my Github profile with all the awsome little coding projects of mine! 
I am a student of Business Information Systems at Oulu University of applied sciences and learning software development. 

This is my second year studying and I am looking for internship positions related to software development. 
My skillset in programming field is basic to intermediate level, but I´m very modest too because I´m from Oulu, Finland. 🚀
Programming technologies are Javascript, CSS, HTML, React and React Native. 
I´m familiar with Kotlin and Jetpack and I´m interested in learning Java if opportunity appears. 💻

 I'm always learning and developing my skills across various technologies. 
 Open to collaboration and ideas 🤝 so feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate or ask anything! 
Join the discussion about my projects or any tech-related topic in GitHub issues.
